# DSA-project

I have developed a C++ project. The experience of applying theoretical knowledge into practical application has been immensely rewarding. The projects include
	
1. Number Game: This project is a console-based number guessing game in C++. Players enter their name, select a difficulty level, and try to guess a randomly generated number within a set range. They start with three hints and can earn more based on performance. The game tracks scores and remaining hints on a leaderboard. The menu lets players play, view the leaderboard, or exit.

2. To Do List: This C++ Task Management System allows users to efficiently manage tasks. Users can add, view, mark as completed, delete, and filter tasks by category. Tasks are stored in a vector, and a menu-driven interface facilitates user interaction. Each task, represented by a class containing its description, category, and completion status, demonstrates basic operations using standard C++ libraries and data structures.

3. Social Media App: This project is a basic social networking application implemented in C++ that allows users to manage friendships, send messages, and create groups. Users can register, establish friendships, and send direct or group messages. The application provides a command-line interface for displaying users, friendships, messages, and group information, serving as a foundational example of handling user data and relationships in C++.
